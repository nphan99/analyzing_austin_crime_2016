# analyzing_austin_crime_2016
In this project, Sam Richins, Kat Rubio, and I analyzed a dataframe with reported crimes in 2016. We focused on finding if any crimes tend to be concentrated in certain areas. We focused on the fbi descriptions, apd description, zip codes, and x and y coordinates. The fbi descriptions are more generalized than the apd descriptions. An example would be the fbi description is Theft and an apd description is Theft from Person We took each the crimes under fbi description (aggrevated assault, theft, robbery, burglary, and murder) and created a heat map of the 2-4 apd descriptions of crimes by making a scatter plot of the x and y coordinates. We then took those apd descriptions that were plotted on the scatter plot and created a bar graph. We took all the accounts from these apd descriptions and broke them up by ZIP code and plotted the top 5 ZIP codes in percent of that apd description crime.
